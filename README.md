# [Accepted] WWDC23 Ciphers

Ciphers is an edutainment app where you learn about some of the cryptography techniques that were used throughout history to conceal messages. 
Through a series of interactive tutorials, the player decodes a cryptic message step-by-step until they find a hidden keyword. 

The goal isn’t to provide a comprehensive explanation of these ciphers but to captivate the player’s interest through engaging interactive design.

Ciphers is built entirely using SwiftUI and supports both light and dark themes. 
The app also features an english haiku I wrote that plays a central role in deciphering the message. Please enjoy it!
